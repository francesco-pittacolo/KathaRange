# Introduction to KathaRange

## Overview

KathaRange is a **container-based cybersecurity network emulation framework** built on the [Kathará API](https://github.com/KatharaFramework/Kathara).
It allows researchers, students, and red/blue teams to deploy **fully customizable cyber-range environments** for realistic attack and defense emulations.

## Purpose


The main goal of KathaRange is to provide a **flexible and reproducible platform** for cybersecurity experimentation, training, and research.  
KathaRange enables users to:

- Design and deploy arbitrary network topologies  
- Integrate offensive and defensive cybersecurity tools  
- Observe realistic network and host behavior in a controlled environment  
- Conduct red-team and blue-team exercises safely and in an automated way

## Key Features

- **Modular lab deployment**: Laboratories are deployed using containerized nodes and configurable YAML files, allowing users to define arbitrary network topologies and services.  
- **Automated attack and defense execution**: Attack and defense actions can be orchestrated through predefined plans, enabling reproducible and controlled scenarios.  
- **Extensible lab scenarios**: Users can easily create or modify labs by adding new nodes, tools, or configurations without altering the core framework.


## Target Audience

- Cybersecurity students and educators
- Red-team and blue-team practitioners
- Security researchers and analysts
